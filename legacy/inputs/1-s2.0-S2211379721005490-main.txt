Keywords: Lotka-Volterra based models COVID-19 Fractional order Stability Controlling virus spread
COVID-19 has become a world wide pandemic since its first appearance at the end of the year 2019. Although some vaccines have already been announced, a new mutant version has been reported in UK. We certainly should be more careful and make further investigations to the virus spread and dynamics. This work investigates dy- namics in Lotka-Volterra based Models of COVID-19. The proposed models involve fractional derivatives which provide more adequacy and realistic description of the natural phenomena arising from such models. Existence and boundedness of non-negative solution of the fractional model is proved. Local stability is also discussed based on Matignon’s stability conditions. Numerical results show that the fractional parameter has effect on flattening the curves of the coexistence steady state. This interesting foundation might be used among the public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 and its mutated versions.
Introduction
In the past months, many scientists have presented papers on the spread of the newly developed COVID-19 virus, which discuss how the virus  has  spread  and  proposals  or  expectations  on  how  to  treat  it medically. Temperature and humidity are from the factors that affect the spread of corona virus. In our work, we will present an analytical study of the dynamic behavior of a new mathematical model of COVID-19 with which we will be interested in studying how the virus infection spreads  and  transmits  from  one  person  to  another  based  on  Lotka- Volterra modeling. We will be interested in studying the equilibrium of the dynamic system and finding numerical and existence of algebraic solutions to the system. This research will contribute to positive results in developing accurate, rapid and economical detection and monitoring mechanisms to reduce the risk of new corona virus [1–9]. In fact, viruses are microorganisms that are nonliving outside the animal or plant cells. They can be polymerized and attached to surfaces till enter the living organism.  Based  on  Baltimore  classification,  viruses  are  classified phenotypically according to type of nucleic acids they possess into seven groups including double strand viruses and single strand viruses. The new corona virus, or simply called COVID-19 is a positive single strand
RNA virus [10]. This means that COVID-19 has highly conserved se- quences in nucleic acids that is maintained by natural selection and therefore it has high mutation rates. Corona virus is one of the most dangerous and deadly diseases in the world today where many people have died due to this serious disease that is still killing the lives of many people around the world. COVID-19 is affecting 208 countries and territories around the world and two in- ternational conveyances. Corona virus threatens the world, which the World Health Organization (WHO) named Covid-19 in reference to the date of its appearance late last year and its affiliation with corona virus. More recently new mutated version of COVID-19 has been found in UK which has faster spread and more deadly effects. Indeed, mathematical models can mimic the effects of the disease on many different factors and levels including high or low temperatures and  high  or  low  humidity  effect.  Data  of  susceptible,  infected  and recovered patients will be collected and analyzed from cold, temperate and hot countries. If we assume that we have a single patient and we begin to study how the disease affects the interactions between cells in that single patient who has become a host of the virus (models inside the host) then we discussed all the methods and factors that help and work to  spread  infection  and  virus  from  this  person  to  the  surrounding

environment through several population groups supposed to be present in  it  through  his  daily  life  that  may  be  separate  (geographically). Recently, there exist models that simulate the spread of disease within cities and among the population, such as those used to predict a COVID- 19 outbreak. Fractional calculus has become chief tool to model physical, engi- neering  and  biological  models  [11–33].  Fractional  calculus  has  also effective tools to describe epidemiological models because it provides more adequacies in estimating the natural behaviors of the model and it also provides higher degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the fractional models involve memory and hereditary properties which are essential to describe the behaviors of ecological models. On the other hand, Lotka- Volterra (LV) family of systems can be used to describe the dynamics of some real world models since the earliest models published by Alfred Lotka  in 1925 [25] and  V. Volterra in 1926  [26]; For  example, LV modeling was used to explore interaction between demand forecasting and competing groups in industry [34]; LV modeling was also used to describe the business cycles in macroeconomics [35]. In addition, the fractional-order  LV  models  showed  better  memory  and  hereditary prosperities in some ecological models [11–14]. In this work, we study some dynamical behaviors in Lotka-Volterra based models of COVID-19 with fractional order. We also discuss exis- tence and boundedness of non-negative solution of the fractional model. We study the stability conditions of the model’s equilibrium points ac- cording to Matignon’s inequalities. We show the effect of fractional parameter on flattening the curves of the coexistence steady state of this mode that could be used among the public health strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its mutated versions.

Remark 1. We can add some stochastic term for system (4) but for simplicity here we ignored it. To  prove  existence  and  boundedness  of  non-negative  solution  of system (4), we introduce the following theorem: Theorem 1. Any solution starts in the set
is bounded. then P = y1(t) +y2(t) Proof. Let DqP(t)⩽ηP(t). (5) Applying the Laplace transform, the last inequality (5) implies that: lim Eα((cid:0) ηtα) = 0. t→∞ Obviously
Obviously ∑∞ tl P(t)⩽P(0) Eα((cid:0) ηt∞), Eα(t) = (1 + lα) l=0 Therefore, any solution starts in this set is bounded.
Therefore, any solution starts in this set is bounded. Our objectives are study the dynamics of model (4) as shown by following sections. Local Stability of model (4) The Jacobian of model (4) is ( )
Lotka-Volterra based models of COVID-19
The mathematical model, we will discuss in this paper, is inspired form  the  classic  Lotka-Volterra  (LV)  model  [34–35]  for  simulation predator–prey dynamics. Here, we can assume that the virus acts as a predator  that  preys  on  individuals.  Then,  the  continuous  mutation processes of the virus, within the host or the infected individual popu- lation, have similar role as the feeding processes of the predator in the LV model. We will get the healthy individual population by y1(t) at time t. the infected individual population is given by y2(t) at time t. Let b > 0 represents the infection rate (1-protection rate), the immigration rate of healthy individuals is given by a > 0, and c > 0 will introduce the immigration rate of infected individuals. Finally, the death rate is given by d > 0 and the cure rate is given by e > 0. dy1 dt = ay1(t) (cid:0) by1(t)y2(t) + ey2(t), (1) dy2 dt = by1(t)y2(t) + (c (cid:0) d (cid:0) e)y2(t). Obviously,  system  (1)  has  two  different  equilibrium  points;  the trivial and coexistence points, respectively: ) (e + d (cid:0) c a(e + d (cid:0) c) , , d ∕= c, b = 0 E1 = (0, 0) , E2 = (2) b b(d (cid:0) c) On the other hand, if model (1) involves fractional derivative, higher accuracy  and  degrees  of  freedom  will  be  obtained.  Therefore,  we introduce the Caputo fractional differential operator as follows [36,37]: ∫ t 1 Dαε(t) = (t (cid:0) η) σ(cid:0) q(cid:0) 1ε(σ)(η)dη, α > 0, σ ∈ Z+, α Γ(σ (cid:0) q) 0 ∈ (σ (cid:0) 1, σ). (3) Hence, replacing the integer-order derivatives with the fractional
Hence, replacing the integer-order derivatives with the fractional operator (3) into model (1), yields Dαy1(t) = ay1(t) (cid:0) by1(t)y2(t) + ey2(t), (4) Dαy2(t) = by1(t)y2(t) + (c (cid:0) d (cid:0) e)y2(t), 0 < α⩽1.
( ) a (cid:0) by2 (cid:0) by1 + e J = (6) by2 by1 + (c (cid:0) d (cid:0) e) Henceforth,  we  refer  by  LAS  to the  locally  asymptotically  stable equilibria. Based on Matignon’s stability theory [35], the equilibrium point of the linearized model (4) is LAS if all the eigenvalues λi, i = 1,2 of the matrix Jfulfill the following inequalities: i = 1, 2. |arg(λi)| > απ/2, (7) If at least one λi  does not achieve inequalities (7), the equilibrium state is not LAS. Hence, we introduce the following stability results: Theorem 2. The trivial equilibrium point of system (4) is not LAS. Moreover, it is saddle when the immigration rate of infected individuals is less than the summation of the death rate and the cure rate (c < d + e). Proof. For the trivial equilibrium point E1 = (0,0), the related ei- genvalues are λ1 = a > 0, λ2 = c (cid:0) (d + e) which imply that |arg(λ1)| = 0, i.e., E1  is not LAS. Moreover, if c < d +e then |arg(λ2)| = π that also implies that trivial point is saddle. Lemma 1. If the immigration rate of infected individuals is more than the summation of death rate and cure rate, then the trivial equilibrium point is unstable node in the integer-order case. Theorem 3. The coexistence equilibrium point of system (4) is LAS if the  death  rate  is  greater  than  the  immigration  rate  of  infected  in- dividuals. However, if the immigration rate of infected individuals is more than the summation of the death rate and the cure rate then the coexistence point is saddle. Proof.  For the coexistence  point  E2 = (((cid:0) c + d + e)/b, (cid:0) a((cid:0) c + d + e)/(bc (cid:0) bd)), the  matrix  J  has  the  eigenvalues  λ1,2 = √ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ (cid:0) ea± (ae)2(cid:0) 4a(c(cid:0) d)2 (d(cid:0) c+e) . When d > c, then λi, i = 1,2 have negative real 2(d(cid:0) c) parts which imply that the coexistence point is LAS. Furthermore, if c > d +e  then  |arg(λ1)| = π  and  |arg(λ2)| = 0  which  implies  that  the coexistence point is saddle. Lemma 2. If the death rate is greater than the immigration rate of infected  individuals,  the  coexistence  point  E2 = (((cid:0) c + d + e)/b, (cid:0) a((cid:0) c + d + e)/(bc (cid:0) bd)) is stable node in the integer-order case pro- . vided that a > 4(c(cid:0) d)2 (d(cid:0) c+e) e2

Conclusion

Numerical results
Here, we discuss some COVID-19 data obtained for Saudi Arabia and collected during the period from March 18, 2020 until November 18, 2020. The death rate resulting from COVID-19 is approximately d = 0.02 and  the  cure  rate  is  approximately  e  = 0.98.  The  infection  rate  is approximately b = 0.01. The immigration rate of healthy individuals is approximately  a  = 0.012  and  the  immigration  rate  of  infected  in- dividuals is approximately c = 0.0001. The model (4) is numerically integrated using the fore-mentioned values of model’s parameters and with orders α = 1, α = 0.9, α = 0.8, α = 0.7 and α = 0.5. The simulation results are summarized in Figs. 1 and 2. The initial conditions used in Figs. 1, 2 are respectively, (y1,y2) = (0.01, 0.01) and (y1,y2) = (99.99, 60.3). The results show that model (4) converges to the coexistence equi- librium point better than the integer-order counterpart (see Fig. 2). To explain this interesting foundation, we recall that the memory effect in the fractional case eliminates the oscillations in its integer-order case after some times. Therefore, model (4), with fractional case, is more adequate to describe the dynamics of the proposed Lotka-Volterra model of COVID-19. The simulation results also illustrate that the fractional parameters can be used as controllers to flattening the curves of infected individuals. So, such models may suggest better public health strategies to mitigate or slow down the fast spread of the deadly pandemic.
This  work  has  investigated  some  dynamical  behaviors  in  Lotka- Volterra based models of COVID-19. The proposed models involve the fractional-order case and its corresponding integer-order counterpart. The existence and boundedness of non-negative solution of the frac- tional model has been proved. Conditions for local stability have been discussed for both fractional and integer-order cases. The influence of the fractional parameter on mitigating the spread of the pandemic has been shown via numerical simulation results.
